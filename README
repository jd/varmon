FAQ:

 1. What does this version support?

    This version of VARMon supports DAC drivers from 2.2.0 up to 2.5.47,
    all the Mylex RAID cards from the 960 and 1100 series and adds support
    for new Mylex cards(eXtremeRAID 2000, eXtremeRAID 3000, AcceleRAID 352,
    and AcceleRAID 170), it also reads SAF-TE from VA and nexStore backplane.


 2. I start it under xterm and it doesn't appear to run properly, what is wrong?

    This program was designed for terminal usage so if you experience weird
    behavior under X terminals play with your "export TERM=" option.
    This is not a bug it's feature of xterminals, since each one has it's own
    way of displaying special characters.


 3. Why is VARMon lagging if I press ESC key?

    That's an ncurses timeout which is used to check if there is an ESC
    sequence about to happen.


 4. There are kernel messages displaying over my terminal when I use VARMon.

    Although the refresh happens every 1.5 seconds it doesn't deal with the
    stealth characters sent by the kernel. At this point you can do two things
    about that, one of them is press the key "r" which will tell VARMon to do a
    hardware refresh off your terminal, the second thing that you can do is
    change your settings for the syslog. You can do so by changing the line:

    kern.*					/dev/console

    to something like 

    kern.*                                      /dev/tty12

    or

    #kern.*                                      /dev/console
    
    in your syslogd configuration file called "/etc/syslog.conf"



 5. I found a bug, what do I do now?

    Let me know about it, I'll fix everything you find.

 7. DAC driver is posting to run "varmon -b" what is that all about?

   Varmon sends an invalid command to the DAC driver, causing the driver
   to reset its command buffer. This is nothing to worry about.
				   

 8. Why is there a file DAC960.h distributed with VARMon?

   This file was taken from the original DAC driver and modified to fit VARMon
   needs. It should not be used to compile the DAC driver.
